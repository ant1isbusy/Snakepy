# Snakepy

A simple terminal snake game in python made for my first semester python course. 

The user enters a single input (wasd) followed by an enter to make the snake move.
A snake has 3 lives and 12 moves per life.


If Q is pressed the game is exited.
If the snake collides with the walls or it loses all its lives, the game ends.


In the end the user can enter his or her name and the last 4 users are saved to a history.txt file.
